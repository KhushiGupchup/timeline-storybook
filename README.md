The Timeline View component was implemented using React.js and integrated within Storybook for interactive visualization and testing. The layout is divided into modular components â€” Timeline, TimelineGrid, TimelineRow, TaskDetailSidebar, and MobileTimelineView. The main Timeline component dynamically calculates date ranges and displays project tasks across three view modes: Day, Week, and Month. Each mode adjusts the visible timeline and grid spacing accordingly, ensuring smooth transitions without changing the original date range. The current day is highlighted with a red indicator line, while each task bar shows progress and duration based on start and end dates.

The design emphasizes responsiveness and accessibility. On larger screens, users can scroll through the timeline horizontally, while on mobile devices, a simplified vertical layout is rendered. The Dark Mode feature was implemented using React state toggling with Tailwind CSS theme classes, ensuring color contrast compliance and consistent styling. The component was tested within Storybook stories for different scenarios (light, dark, mobile, and empty states), demonstrating modularity, reusability, and adaptability for real-world project tracking interfaces.
